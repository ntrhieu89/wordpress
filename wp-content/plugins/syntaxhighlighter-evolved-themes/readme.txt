1. Upload `syntaxhighlighter-evolved-themes` to your `/plugins/` directory for WordPress
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will you add new themes?

Of course (when I have a time), just [send me a request](http://kopepasah.com/contact). In your request, be sure to describe the theme in detail or send me a link to a colorscheme of a theme. A simple screenshot will not suffice.
